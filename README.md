# Midland Real Estate Bot

## General Information

The **Midland Real Estate Bot** was originally developed as a freelance project for a client on Upwork.  
After successfully using the bot for their own operations, I decided to **open-source** the project on GitHub to allow others facing similar challenges to benefit from it as well.

### Problem Background

On the Midland Real Estate website, property listings go live at unpredictable times.  
Clients must constantly monitor the platform and act quickly, as listings are awarded on a **first-come, first-served** basis.  
However, the application process is **lengthy** — spanning about **seven pages** — making it extremely difficult to submit an application faster than competitors manually.

This often resulted in missed opportunities, even when users were monitoring the website closely.

### Purpose of the Bot

The **Midland Real Estate Bot** was built to solve this exact problem.  
It automatically monitors the Midland website for new listings, and once a listing becomes available, it:

- Instantly initiates the application
- Auto-fills the necessary forms across all seven pages
- Uploads any required documents or images
- Submits the application at speeds no human could match

The primary goal: **Beat everyone else and be the first to apply.**

## Results Achieved

Since deploying the Midland Real Estate Bot:

- **Application time dropped by over 80%**, completing the 7-page process in just a few seconds.
- **First-mover advantage** significantly improved, with users often being the first applicants.
- **Error rates minimized**, especially on critical form fields.
- **Manual monitoring eliminated**, allowing clients to focus on more important tasks.
- **Higher success rate** in securing properties against intense competition.

The bot has proven itself as a **game-changer** for those seeking to gain a competitive edge in real estate applications.
